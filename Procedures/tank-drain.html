7.
If tank pressure is higher than 5psi,
pull the pressure-release ring on the compressor.
<p>(You can skip steps 3&nbsp;--&nbsp;5 and just use the
release ring to drain a full tank,
but it makes a really abrupt, loud noise
when activated at high pressures.)

8.
Place newspaper under the compressor.
<br>Open the tank drain screw.
<br>Rusty water will drip out.
<br>Let it drip for a few minutes.
<br>Gently close the tank drain screw.

9.
Turn on the compressor switch.
<br>The compressor will run for a few minutes to restore the tank
and pipeline pressure to 115psi.
