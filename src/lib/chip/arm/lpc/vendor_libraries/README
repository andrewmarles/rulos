		...with some files added from
		LPCXpresso LPC11C24 board v2.00a

	Notes:
		The LPC1114 is covered under LPC11CXX.

		The LPCopen library for the 11UXX is diff-identical to the 11CXX except:

		    * The 11CXX library doesn't have the USB support
                      library, since those parts don't have USB.

		    * The 11CXX library has some extra files for doing
                      a different style of GPIO, and the CMSIS.h
                      header for the 11Cxx line. I combined all the
                      files into the 11UXX directory. Unfortunately,
                      the 11Axx, 11Exx headers are missing. I really
                      wish LPCopen would just give you a centralized
                      single place to download drivers instead of
                      giving different subsets of the files out
                      piecemeal. There doesn't seem to be an 11AXX
                      LPCxpresso board so who knows where
                      cmsis_11axx.h is?

		    * A different CHIP constant was defined by default
                      in sys_config.h. I've commented out all CHIP
                      definitions so the build system can define it
                      instead.
