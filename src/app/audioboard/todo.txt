{hardware}
[ ] bigger 5v caps to clean power supply
[ ] with jer: figure if we can configure op-amp to do what LM386 does.
[ ] with jer's scope: scope output on triangle wave & clean it up (/||\/\/\)
[ ] ADC

{mounting}
[ ] space joystick cable off its board to clear audio board hardware
[ ] mount ROCKET0 programming header to plexi
[ ] add lots of screws to panels!

{software}
[x] SPI error -> silence
[x] volume knob
[ ] disco music control interface
[ ] volume knob UI
[ ] turn off volume prescaling in compile_audio
[U] crank audioboard up to higher sample rate; fix 8-bit overflow bigger buffers
	-- nope, AO_BUFLENG2==9 pushes RAM requirements to 2076; we just don't
	have enough memory to use bigger buffers on this chip.
	Why can't we move audio faster with small buffers? (not enough buffer
	to wait for SPI overhead? What's max rate we can pump SPI?)
Dang, BUFLENLG2=8 stopped working (ran out of RAM?); =7 too slow (due to volume?)
	...although we're 43% idle. That's busy, but not so busy that I still
	wonder why we're missing the deadline. Need to carefully analyze time
	budget (with logic analyzer?).
[ ] eliminate startup click (probably 0s to 127s)

[ ] longer booster noise to avoid click/pop

[ ] add uart_network debug message "stderr" path
[ ] report idle % for audioboard
[ ] intercom code

[ ] serial/eth adaptor
