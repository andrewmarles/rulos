test runtime baud rate computation

[] audio decoupling transformer (hardware)

[] code STREAMING_AUDIO_PORT into a module for app/audioboard & test!

discontinuous play of booster noise
	(probably just an alignment problem)
	..got better when I aligned, but I think we're slipping a frame.
	meh.

add disco music invocations (have to update ROCKET)
	it'd be nice to have an index with a turny knob, wouldn't it?

uart network
	-- got board-side code done; need to create uartnetworkhost that actually
	creates well-formed packets.

add uart_network debug message "stderr" path

stream uart audio into rocket
mic input (hardware)

mounting:
	space joystick cable off its board to clear audio board hardware
	mount ROCKET0 programming header to plexi
	add lots of screws to panels!
